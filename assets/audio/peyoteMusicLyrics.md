[Verse]
Under the sun where the shadows play
Cactus whispers guide the way
A mirage dancing in the heat's sway
Peyote dreams until the break of day

[Verse 2]
Footsteps echo on a dusty trail
Time moves slow like an ancient tale
Through the dunes where secrets sail
A game of fate is about to unveil

[Chorus]
Roll the dice beneath moonlight
Cards are falling
Stars ignite
Desert spirit
Take your flight
Lost in the game 'til morning light

[Verse 3]
Winds are howling
Stories untold
A world of wonder you’ll behold
The earth hums low
The night turns cold
Peyote visions breaking the mold

[Bridge]
Close your eyes
The echoes rise
A cosmic pull you can't disguise
The truth is hiding in the skies
A desert melody
Hypnotized

[Chorus]
Roll the dice beneath moonlight
Cards are falling
Stars ignite
Desert spirit
Take your flight
Lost in the game 'til morning light
